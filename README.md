### Guess The Color

I was wondering how to solve this [quiz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3937792/29318853-f61d7c4a-81fb-11e7-85ed-11eea1283823.jpg) challenge. 

I come up with this:

### Pros:
- a lot of DOM manipulation
- a lot of event handling


### Cons:
- not so clean code
- bad commenting (mixing language Indonesia & English)
- not following any design pattern
- smells DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in some code. But I'm sure it is not spaghetti code either
